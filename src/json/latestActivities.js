  `For the 3rd edition of summer school IEEE RAS INSAT SBC organized two workshops:

  -ARDUINO level 0: The Attendees discovered the arduino board and its components, then they learnt to program it in order to light up a LED. Finally, we challenged them to make a mini project on their own using the knowledge they learnt.

  -Solidworks: The attendees discovered the softwareâ€™s features and tools and made some basic 3D objects then they were guided to design a more complex model.`,
